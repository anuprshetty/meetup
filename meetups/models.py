# ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)
# - An object-relational mapper is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code.
# - Objectâ€“Relational Mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.
